Hey guys, welcome to Python 3 Course! Let me share information. 

Q: "Why is it named Python?"

A: "When he began implementing Python, Guido van Rossum (Python inventor) was also reading the published scripts from “Monty Python’s Flying Circus”, a BBC comedy series from the 1970s. Van Rossum thought he needed a name that was short, unique, and slightly mysterious, so he decided to call the language Python." - www.python.org

Well, not so important. Just in case you are curious about its name origin.

Python is a Scripting Language. It's a standalone program that does not load any external module, library function or program and is designed to boot with the bootstrap procedure of the target processor.
